# Cuda
> 

I wanted to do: 
* fibonacci sequence 
* Moore penrose inverse (SVD beign a [prereq](https://hadrienj.github.io/posts/Deep-Learning-Book-Series-2.9-The-Moore-Penrose-Pseudoinverse/))
* Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) 
* OLS with l2 regularization

Id rather jump a higher level of abstraction, all I want for christmas is a (user friendly) math library... like math from java with the basis from numpy.linAlg

I didnâ€™t like the cuda linear algebra library, cuBLAS, so i switched to CuPy
