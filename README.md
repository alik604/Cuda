# Cuda
> This project is deprecated. I hated coding for CUDA and don't see myself interested in trying to do it in the future. My goal was to know enough to modify code to suit my purposes, ie a custom activation function for a neural network.  

I wanted to do: 
* fibonacci sequence 
* Moore penrose inverse (SVD being a [prereq](https://hadrienj.github.io/posts/Deep-Learning-Book-Series-2.9-The-Moore-Penrose-Pseudoinverse/))
* [Done - CuPy] Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) 
* [Done - CuPy] OLS with l2 regularization

Id rather jump a higher level of abstraction, all I want for christmas is a (user friendly) math library... like math from Java or `numpy.linAlg`

I didnâ€™t like the cuda linear algebra library, cuBLAS, so i switched to CuPy
